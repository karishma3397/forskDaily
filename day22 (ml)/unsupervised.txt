Unsupervised learning:
	no labels so no predictions from features
	
	we can only divide the data to clusters which exhibits similar properties
	
	voronoid diagram(check)
	
	wcss:within clusters sum of squares
	
	kmeans.inertia : gives value of wcss
	
	elbow method: knee band gives the clusters, max angle gives right no of clusters
