Multiple linear regression:
	multiple collinearity(if we can find the value of last column by use of previous columns
	in one hot encoding)
	Dummy variable trap : Dropping last column
	
	
	P-Value : probability of a column that a column came into our data set just by chance.
	  
		backward elimimation: removing columns whose p-values are greater than 5.
